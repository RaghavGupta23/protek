     <p>
I am a UI front end developer and testing intern at Tuutkia. Before this, I completed my Bachelors in Software Engineering and Minor in Mathematics from San Jose State in December 2018. In the 4 year curriculum, I dealt with many aspects of coding principles and practices such as Agile methodology, continuous integration and delivery. I have primarily experienced in React framework. I have a major project Uniforms in React. Another project of mine is GetAway in which I have done mutation testing and Blackbox testing and domain testing. In my past experience I have also learned many things about testing. I began with doing mutation testing in my early projects. Later on I leaned about domain testing and data flow testing and using tools like Postman for testing restAPI and jenkins which fastens the process of black box testing in deployable web applications.
After graduation I moved towards interning at Tuutkia, as a front end UI developer and a tester.
